## Feature
### 1. Asteroids

> ‚òÑÔ∏è Asteroids are target to shoot. When you hit by Asteroids, you lose 1 life

There's 3 types of Asteroids: `Big` `Midium` `Small`. When asteroid get hit by bullet, it usually splits into two smaller types of asteroids and in case of `small` asteroid (which is smallest one), it vanished.

When Asteroid is splited, thier moving direction also changes randomly in 3 types: `Horizontal` `Right Up` `Right Down`
From graph above, `(a,b)` is direction of existing asteroid

### 2. Waves

> üåä When you destroys all asteroids, you will face harder tiral...

Wen player destroys all asteroids, next wave with **more and faster asteroids** is comming. Speed and number of asteroids are decided by internal formula. Thus, there are endless wave.

### 3. Power Ups

> üîã The more waves you beat, the more difficult waves are comming. You should be stronger with these Power Ups 
> You can get Power Ups when you beat wave (100%) or hit astroid (with low chance)

**Fire Faster** Makes you to fire faster. This reduce delay between shoots.

**1 more Life** Getting hit by asteroids is inevitable. Recharge more life as much as you can and prepare for harder wave
